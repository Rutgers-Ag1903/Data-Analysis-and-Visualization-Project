### Data Cleaning & Preparation

⋆ The data was sourced from the World Bank Data Catalog. 

⋆ With the acquisition of the raw data, we were required to significantly process it, in order for it to become usable for analysis. This was done through cleaning the data by checking for missing values, duplicates, etc. 

⋆ Different countries and regions reported data in varying formats and time intervals. We standardized all data to annual metrics for consistent comparison.

⋆ All data was aligned to consistent yearly intervals, with particular focus on 2018 for regional comparisons.

⋆ The data was grouped by region (Africa, Asia, Middle-East, etc.) to identify regional patterns while maintaining country level granularity where needed.
